### Detector

We offer two different detectors, built by VITA laboratory: 

* **Minion (Default)** 

Minion images detector. Reference: https://github.com/vita-epfl/socket-loomo/blob/master/python/detector.py
  
* **Openpifpaf** 

Human detector. Reference: https://github.com/vita-epfl/openpifpaf

**Comparison between both detectors:**

| Detector Name     | (w, h, c)     | dt_perception     | dt_control        | time_horizon_control  | type_input    |
| :----:            | :------:      | :------:          | :------:          | :------:              | :------:      |
| Default           | (80, 60, 3)   | 0.1 s             | 0.2 s             | 1 s                   | opencv        |
| Openpifpaf        | (161, 107, 3) | 0.25 s            | 0.5 s             | 3 s                   | pil           |

All real time detectors can be added inside the pipeline, setting the required parameters.

``` python 
detection_image = DetectorConfig(width=w, height=h, channels=c, downscale=d,
                                        global_path='path', detector=detector_class(),
                                        load=bool, type_input=t) 
```

Where ```width```, ```height``` and ```channels``` are the sizes expected by ```detector```, and ```downscale``` is the resize relation between detection size product _(w路h路c)_ and Loomo camera size multiplication _(80路60路3)_. If we need to load a model for the detector, we use parameter ```load=True ``` and we add set ```global_path='path_to_model'```. ```type_input``` depends on detector's input requirements, usually varying between _opencv_ and _pil_ modules.

Finally, in every iteretion, attribute ```detect``` from class ```DetectorConfig``` is used in order to output bounding boxes and labels with the remarked observations. 

``` python
bbox_list, label_list = detection_image.detect(received_image)
```
